### Intro

**Ruomeng Liu**Â is currently an undergraduate student atÂ [University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences](https://www.ucass.edu.cn/en/index.htm)Â , advised by ProfessorÂ [Fen Xiang](http://www.mediaresearch.cn/xwx/sdtj/201510/t20151010_2489106.shtml)Â at [Institue of Journalism and Communication](http://www.mediaresearch.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Social Sciences](http://casseng.cssn.cn/). I also studied at [University of California, Davis](https://communication.ucdavis.edu/) as an exchange student. My research interests primarily revolve aroundÂ _political communication_Â andÂ _media cognition_. I'm particularly interested in how people make decisions within a high-choice media environment. I'm interestd in the [choice's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_modelling) (distrust, cynicism, preference) ramifications and its interplay with politics. Additionally, I often emphasize the significant role of culture in these processes.

From a simple love for news to my practical experiences and academic reflections on media during my university years, I have always sought to connect intellectual inquiry with real-life encounters. During high school, I developed a fondness for reading magazines likeÂ [Vista](http://www.vistastory.com/#/about?columnType=1)Â andÂ [Lifeweek](https://www.lifeweek.com.cn/), which deepened my interest in print media. At my early time, I developed a passion for non-fiction and long investigative reports. Chinese journalistsÂ [Chai Jing](https://www.youtube.com/@chaijing2023)Â and Li Haipeng were my favorite feature reporters.

### Research
Academically, I have been influenced by my undergraduate advisor, which led me to consciously explore the impact of theory and history on journalism research and communication sociology. The emphasis on politics/power from my advisor also affected me. In fact, I find myself caught between quantitative methodology and theoretical exploration. I am both fascinated by the pursuit of certainty, akin to econometrics, and believe that academia should not be completely detached from politics or personal perspectives. It is essential to maintain a focus on the humanistic spirit within theory and research, for example, _theory-oriented empirical research_.

Specifically in my academic pursuits, I am simultaneously interested in **political communication** in China and the societal impact of **emerging technologies**. I have delved into the microsociology behind the resurgence ofÂ **party media in China**(accepted by [IAMCR](https://iamcr.org/)) and am currently conducting research onÂ **insult discourse toward China**. To collect and analyze data for my research, I employ various methods such as surveys, data mining, and natural language processing etc.

In addition to my focus on political communication, I am also intrigued by mobile technology and the future development of media, as well as their societal implications. Currently, I am collaborating with colleagues on a research project exploringÂ **media multitasking**(extended abstract accepted by [MSC2023](https://www.msi.wiki/mobile-studies-congress-2023)).

In general, I am commited to explore the complex issues under the transformative nature of today's high-choice media environment. In my secondary school days, although there's an intense competition and an "ultimate" goal called "Gaokao", my math teacher always told us that "Making choice is much more important than making efforts". Choice as a most basic elements of the societal process needs more attention, and I'm interested in understanding how the choice is shaped and the underlying mechanism/explanation.

### Methodology

Methodologically, I lean towards quantitative approaches, including traditional inferential statistics, while also expanding my knowledge of popular machine learning algorithms. I primarily utilize R as my primary tool, with Python serving as a supplementary language.

I have a strong passion for computational social sciences, an exciting and rapidly-evolving interdisciplinary field. My learning journey includes text-as-data, image-as-data, video/audio-as-data and multimedia analysis, as well as computing knowledge about deep learning and large laguage modeling.

Before completing my undergraduate studies, I will have explored various professional domains, including data journalism, public relations, and news reporting. In the future, I may become a researcher, a journalist, or anything else. Regardless of the path I choose, my commitment remains steadfastâ€”to delve deeper into my areas of interest and contribute to the understanding and practice of media and communication. I aspire to merge rigorous academic pursuits with a keen awareness of the social and human aspects of these fields.
